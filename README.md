## 👋 Hello, I'm Jianfei Yang!  

🚀 **Assistant Professor at NTU**   
🪐**Leading Multimodal AI & Robotic Systems (MARS) Lab**     

I am an **Assistant Professor at Nanyang Technological University (NTU)**, leading the **Multimodal AI and Robotic Systems (MARS) Lab**. My group studies **Physical AI**, focusing on how **AI enables physical systems**—such as **robotics, IoT, and industrial automation**—to perceive, understand, and interact with the real world.  

Much like human intelligence, AI evolves by continuously gaining and exchanging information with its environment. This drives our Physical AI research in:  
- **Embodied/Physical AI** 🦾: AI-driven robotic perception, locomotion, and manipulation.  
- **Multimodal Perception** 🤖: Integrating vision, radar, and wireless sensing for real-world physical intelligence.  
- **On-Device AI** 🧠: Exploring compact, real-time AI models for mobile and robotics applications.
